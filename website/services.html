                    <p> 
                        Education should adapt to your needs - not the other way around. AdaptiveLearn 
                        is the solution to the problem of assuming everybody learns in the way. On the 
                        contrary, everybody is different and everybody learns with different pace 
                        and style. AdaptiveLearn uses your learning activities to recommend future 
                        topics, provide an overview of progress and a summary of your work. In this way, 
                        you are able to always know where you are, what you've done, and where you're 
                        going.
